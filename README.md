##  Project Overview

This interactive web-based dashboard visualizes equipment failure predictions using machine learning algorithms trained on 10 years of operational data from WB Power Services Ltd's Protean database system.

### Key Features

-  **Real-time Risk Prediction**: Predict equipment failure risk with 96.52% F1 score
-  **Interactive Visualizations**: Dynamic charts showing model performance and risk patterns
-  **HDG Equipment Analysis**: Detailed analysis of Hire Desk Group (HDG) equipment showing 12.9× higher failure risk
-  **Bathtub Curve Analysis**: Equipment age-based failure patterns
-  **Feature Importance**: Top predictive features from the LightGBM model
-  **Responsive Design**: Works on desktop, tablet, and mobile devices
